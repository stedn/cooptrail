We welcome you to join us in [our mission](about.html) to raise awareness about the cooperative economy!  We welcome new Member Organizations, Trail Curators and Community Members.

If your organization is a co-op or part of the solidarity economy you can become a part of the Co-Op Trail as a Member Organization to be added to the trail. Or if you're interested in adding content to the Co-Op Trail or documenting your travels, you can also join as a Trail Curator. To learn more about these roles and how our organization works visit our <a href="/resources.html">Resources Page</a>.

To get involved, you can contact us using the form below, by <a href="mailto:thecooptrail@gmail.com">email</a>, or by joining our group on the <a href="https://www.hylo.com/groups/coop-trail">Hylo organizing platform</a>. And if you are just interested in learning more, you can join our community just by <a href="/signup.html">signing up for our mailing list</a>. Whatever works best for you.

Happy Trails!
