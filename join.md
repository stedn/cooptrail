We welcome you to join us in [our mission](about.html) to raise awareness about the cooperative economy!

You and your organization can become a part of the Co-Op Trail as a Member Organization by using the form below to reach out.  We'll respond to plan when we can visit you to add you to the trail.

If you're interested in adding to the Co-Op Trail, you can also join as a Trail Curator.  Contact us with the form below and we can help you get set up documenting your own segment of the trail. We offer lots of support to our trail curators, and part of any proceeds goes back to support all of our Trail Curators.

You can contact us with the form or by email or phone. Whatever is easiest for you.  Happy Trails!
