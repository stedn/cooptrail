The Trail Co-op is launching this summer. We plan to have local trips running all over the country with the goal of diverting thousands of flights and building a community for a more regenerative world.

To stay informed as we launch, sign up for our email here.

The revolution in local regenerative travel happens one person at a time.  If you'd like to get involved helping the co-op build local outdoor adventures in your area, join our <a href="https://discord.gg/6VbCwAcHwg">Discord</a> or <a href="">Hylo</a> groups or just send us an <a href="mailto:thecooptrail@gmail.com">email</a>.

Happy Trails!
