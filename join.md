We welcome you to join us in [our mission](story.html) to travel better and support a transition to a regenerative and cooperative economy.  There are many ways to get involved with our community. Participation is entirely <strong>free</strong> and <strong>voluntary</strong>.

The easiest way to contribute in these efforts is to join an outdoor group in your area and promote local travel to beautiful and adventurous destinations nearby. Check out [our map](map.html) to find outdoor groups that are supportive of our mission near you.  If you have any organizations or trails that you'd like to document in your area, add them to our map by filling out the form on the region page!

If you can't find an outdoor group on our map, you can help us expand in your area.  Contact us using the form below, by <a href="mailto:thecooptrail@gmail.com">email</a>, or by joining our <a href="https://discord.gg/6VbCwAcHwg">Discord group</a>or <a href=https://www.hylo.com/groups/coop-trail>Hylo group</a>. Or if you are just interested in learning more, you can join our community just by <a href="/signup.html">signing up for our mailing list</a>. Whatever works best for you.

And at the Trail Cooperative, just by participating in this organization, you become a member and owner of the work we do.  Check out our [resources page](resources.html) for more information on how we are building this cooperative.

Happy Trails!
