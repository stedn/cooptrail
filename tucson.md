Tucson sits in the heart of the Sonoran Desert, a desert that's almost as lush, green, and full of life as any other habitat.  Touring this area provides wide open spaces, towering peaks, and verdant washes to explore.  In all the places we've been there really isn't any other place that feels quite like Tucson.
