description: BikeToHike Central
blurb: "The western Washington area is one of the first explored and all-time favorite regions we've seen. It is the perfect place for fantastic #HikeToBike trips into the national parks at <a href='#'>Mt. Rainier</a> and Olympic Peninsula.  It has the amazing Olympic Discovery Trail with over 100 miles of off-highway riding.  The cities of Bellingham and Port Townsend were terrific smaller towns with excellend cycling infrastructure and ethical cooperatives for cycling and food. The San Juan islands offer an amazing journey by ferry for free amongsth these quaint island vibes.  And at the center, the city of Seattle offers excellent infrastructure, an interesting mix of working and modern tech culture, and a storied history of supporting cooperatives."
