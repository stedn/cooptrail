For our trip, we didn’t start out with the intention of a long distance bike trip in the same way most cycle tourers might.  Our dream had actually been to combine #vanlife with a bunch of amazing backpacking adventures.  But the more we thought about this, the more it just felt wrong to go driving all over the country knowing the environmental damage that driving a big carbon emitting vehicle would cause.  We were longing for a better way to carry all the gear we needed for backcountry adventure, without relying on fossil fuels.

So the idea for solar powered bicycles evolved naturally from this challenge.  We started by thinking about just using standard (non-electric) bikes, but we realized it just wouldn’t be possible to carry the food and gear we needed for the backpacking trips we wanted to do.  We next contemplated ebikes, but quickly realized that it would be impossible to keep them charged on the distances we were going between towns. And nothing is worse than riding a heavy ebike after it's out of power.  So this was when we came up with the solar charging ebike idea.  Fortunately, many many people have already worked on these ideas for several years so we had lots of great ideas to start from.

So we set to work building our tandem electric bike and an accompanying trailer.  For this first project, Will wrote <a href="https://bonkerfield.org/2021/01/ebike-solar-trailer/">a detailed account</a> on his personal blog for those interested to learn more.

Here Claire gave us a walk-through of the design of the initial prototype.

With the tandem bike and double trailer, the rig ended up being extremely long! We knew from the beginning that our trip would be full of trial-and-error, and that we would need to work out redesigns along the way.

After a few tests around the block, we decided to test this crazy machine on a 3 night backpacking trip at a hot springs trail about 50 miles away.

After a 50 mile ride along the bluffs of the Northern California coast from Mendocino to Point Arena complete with rolling hills and ocean spray, we turned inland at Point Arena to reach the hike up the Garcia River.

We found <a href="https://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM29GE">directions</a> along the Garcia River to the remote hot springs.  The hike up was a long but beautiful 9 miles and filled with more than 50 refreshing river crossings.  Very close to the springs we scrambled the rocks to reach the relaxing end.

We stayed close to springs overnight and returned to the trailhead the next day.  We stayed overnight in the forest near the trailhead, and rode back down into Point Arena.  We restocked on supplies for the ride back and grabbed our breakfast and coffee at the Arena Market and Cafe.

We rode the same path in reverse back to our house near the charming little village of Mendocino.  Mendocino is a really beautiful place and so full of history&mdash;especially history about cooperatives.  Living nearby, we learned so much about the solidarity economy from neighbors as well as the <a href="http://www.grassroots-institute.org/">Grassroots Institute</a>

Mendocino has a number of worker co-ops including the <a href="https://www.artcoopmendocino.com/">Artists' Co-op Gallery</a> and <a href="http://www.cornersofthemouth.com/">Corners of the Mouth Natural Food Store</a>.  During our time in this area, we interviewed the worker and artist-owners of these cooperatives for our documentary series.

#### Rebuilding the tandem with lighter materials

Our first trip taught us that our equipment was very, very heavy.  Before leaving, we undertook our first major rebuild of switching to lightweight solar panels to try to alleviate some of our weight burden.
<div style="text-align:center">
<img style="width:20%;" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLWiUqvMEZbbqUFZAq15uC9TbugncrhTiYesDdVFPfVX4EtNjRKujVarxwsdUvI4uOeAg5YrZY9MTg9KrMqLpCEAw8rVnV72v2RhPhsNw8VOAYpncok2iPOsyvRhm0M54bzbZ6d2530uLqrPFNMRvxhzWw=w504-h671-no">

We were able to find some relatively inexpensive but extremely lightweight solar panels from ebay.  Each panel was 130 Watts, and they weighed a mere 4 lbs a piece.  This was in contrast to our original hand-me-down panels which were each more than 20 lbs.  This rebuild also made it so that we could afford to use less material in our mounting device, saving even more weight from the final design. An added bonus was that for about the same size, we were also getting more than 40% more power from the new panels, which would greatly reduce our recharge time.

All-in-all, this turned out to be only the first redesign of many to come, but by this point time was running out to begin our tour…

We set out north along Highway 1, with its epic coastline of cliffs that drop down to the ocean below. Once we got north of Fort Bragg the traffic lessened and the road morphed into easily rideable rolling green hills with serene views of green pastures overlooking the ocean&mdash;and wild blackberries if you're there in summer.

After Westport, the highway turns inland and starts a steep climb to get over the south end of the King Range and connect with Highway 101. This climb was rough, it's windy, narrow, and steep. We’d climbed steeper ascents with our loaded etandem along the coast before, but nothing we’d ridden up to then had been so steep for such a long time (nearly 10 miles of steady uphill). What made matters worse: Claire is somewhat of a water paranoid person (nicknamed the Water Goblin), and when we started the climb we were heavily loaded with nearly two gallons of extra water!  Before a half mile, we had pulled over to dump the excess water: 4 liters would have to appease the Water Goblin on this tour.

We had made it much less distance than we’d imagined.  As dusk was approaching we were far from any place that we’d planned to find secluded camping.  We took a risk, and went off-road down a small 4-wheeler track to stay the night in our first “stealth camp.”

In the morning, we woke up at dawn to try to prevent being found in someone’s way.  We continued the climb but must have started a little too cold because Will’s back almost immediately seized up.  Within a few miles of starting to ride, we had to take a long stretching break on the side of the road overlooking a huge forest of Redwood logging land.  It was good we stopped because within a few minutes a car pulled up the road holding one of our trailer's wheels! Apparently we hadn’t fastened it securely enough and probably taking it off-road the night before had loosened it up.

After the helpful driver pulled away, we took a good long look at each other.  Were we cut out for this?

We continued the climb and our first real descent down into Legget.  Hopping onto 101 here wasn't bad, there was a decent shoulder, and views of the Eel River as it snakes back and forth below.

We made up some distance, but still didn’t make it as far as we’d planned.  Although we didn’t know it at the time, we had made it fairly close to a hiker-biker camp.  But not knowing where to go, we lucked out and found a very beautiful spot down near the banks of the Eel River for night two of our boondocking tour.

On the third day we woke up and rode almost immediately into the Avenue of the Giants, a scenic route off 101 that travels through the old growth redwoods. It's magical to bike through these ancient trees. Humbolt Redwoods State Park is along this road and has many trails and groves to explore.


The Wildcat was too much for us, with crushingly steep grades coming out of Ferndale, CA.  Even with our motor on maximum we were literally stalling out with all our gear.  Something was going to have to give.  We folded our tail between our legs and headed back down into Petrolia to get a hotel room.  But we were determined! We would regroup overnight and find a way up that hill!

By the morning we had a plan. We’d pack our backpacks with as much gear as we could fit to lighten our load, and leave them overnight with the hotel.  And it worked! We made it up and over the Wildcat right.

From Ferndale, there is a killer climb from up over the North end of the King Range but you are rewarded with gorgeous green mountain meadows. The road traverses for awhile and then drops down into a valley, which means another steep climb out.  The second climb turned out to be even steeper than the first.  But we knew we were already close enough to our destination that we didn’t need our solar panels for this quick out and back.  We found a rancher in the valley and asked if we could leave our solar charging trailer locked up on the side of the road.  He obliged us and we made the last climb over to the coast where we got some stunning views of the big blue Pacific and the rocky outcroppings that dot the shoreline.

At this point, when we biked down “the wall” was when we started to get into our real trouble. A combination of rough road, heavy tandem bike, and inadequate tires made for frequent flats.  After about the third or fourth we started to have trouble patching. Following the road along the coast was absolutely gorgeous but also stressful as we noticed that we had to stop to inflate more frequently. At the turn up the Mattole Valley, we finally just had to stop, expecting that perhaps we’d need to wait it out in a camp on the beautiful (but windy) beach before walking into Petrolia for a bailout the next morning.  Fortunately, a friendly surfer stopped on his way up from the beach and offered to grab a new tire for us from his place.  This held and kept us moving up into the Mattole valley. As dusk was settling, we turned the corner to find the houses of the tiny town of Petrolia peek up from among the hills as we wound our way inland.

We were planning to stay with a host Drew from the Uplift Cannabis Co-op so that we could interview him about his cooperative in the morning.  We reached him after dark, but he was so kind that he even got up to make Claire pancakes.  We woke up in the morning and interviewed him, learning so much about their work with producer cooperatives and growing cannabis in this beautiful place.

We learned so much from interviewing Drew.  He taught us about the history of the rural sharing economy, social structure of the Mattole Valley and cannabis farming.  It was fascinating to learn about the way the local growers were banding together to fight back against the major industrial players entering the cannabis space.  It was also fascinating to learn about the specific ecological factors that made the farms of the Mattole Valley such a unique place to grow cannabis.

Immediately after interviewing Drew, we had to set out to make it back over the range and into Arcata.  We stopped before leaving Petrolia to meet the town bike mechanic, Cedar, who showed us into his workshop in between rounds of milking the cows.  We bought a few extra tubes from him for the road, and off we went back up and over the Wildcat.  But this time, after riding over the range, we continued on all the way to Arcata, for our longest ride thus far (70 miles). We made it to Hoopla farm to stay with our Warmshowers hosts, Evelyn and Wallace on their small farm full of free range chickens, veggies and golden berries (like small sweet tomatoes). They shared their experience of raising chickens and communal living on their property (there is a tiny house in the back of the main house).

### Visiting Cooperatives in Arcata CA
We spent several days in Arcata to explore the place, relax for a while, edit some videos, teach an online course, and interview one of the coolest cooperatives that we've ever had the pleasure of meeting.  We were so lucky to get to meet the folks who started Full Cycle Compost, a cooperative company that offers curbside compost pickup (on their bike), which goes to make compost for community gardens and farms.  We filmed another interview with them on their work and how forming as a cooperative is

During our time in Arcata, we also made the decision to convert our trailer from two buggies down to one. We realized we could just stack our solar panels while riding even though that would halve the amount of power we were getting while on-the-go.  Overall, that wasn't too big of a deal because we were still spending plenty of time taking breaks where we could lay both panels out.   We sent a small box of things back to our family for safekeeping, and dropped our trailer off at <a href="https://www.arcatamooncycles.com/services">Moon Cycle</a>.  It was much better only riding with one trailer and made things a lot easier.

Starting in Arcata, CA stocking up at the North Coast Co-op, we left Arcata via the Hammond Coastal Trail, a local favorite that we learned about from the fantastic folx at <a href="https://www.arcatamooncycles.com/">Moon Cycles Collective</a>. After about 9 miles, this joined back up with Highway 101, which we rode over two days stopping overnight at the Trinidad North rest area just for a quick sleep.

We turned off Highway 101 again to take the beautiful Newton B Drury Scenic Houte which leads to the hiker/biker camp at Elk Meadow Campground in Elk Prairie Redwoods National Park.  This is one of the best hiker/biker areas we stayed at and highly recommended for the views of the elk herd in the area.

The next leg of the trip returns to 101 for a somewhat frustrating but necessary ride along a few shoulderless steep stretches.  Just after entering Crescent City, take Elk Valley Rd to Jedidiah State Park for another hiker/biker.  At this park, you can also see the rare albino redwoods, which don't produce chlorophyll in their leaves instead relying on nutrients from neighboring trees.

On the next day, we crossed the California Oregon border. Just past the first major town, Brookings, you'll find the Hastings Beach State Park, another great hiker/biker camp.  Alternatively, it is said that despite Oregon beaches being "free to camp," Brookings is one of the only major cities to allow beach camping so near to it.  If you are so inclined, a tent on the sandy beaches around Brookings could be an interesting way to start a tour into Oregon.


It was at this part of the trip that we finally started to feel like we were getting things under control.  Our rig was much lighter and we were traveling fast enough to start visiting places.  We made this short video to explain how we were getting around.

The whole of the Southern Oregon coast is a beautiful and interesting landscape to ride.  The southern portion of this route felt like one of the safer cycling routes compared to other parts of coastal Highway 101.

We rode 77 miles of coast from Hastings Park to the small town of Port Orford where we loaded up on delicious locally grown food at the Port Orford Food Co-op. We stayed the night near Port Orford in a dispersed campsite just off Elk River Rd rode along the calm and beautiful Elk Creek in the Grassy Knob Wilderness of the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest.

The next leg stretched from Port Orford to Sunset Bay State Park just south of Coos Bay.  From Sunset Bay we day tripped into Coos Bay to visit the Coos Head Food Co-op for supplies and paid a visit to the Front Street Community Bikeworks to take care of some maintenance on our bike.



From Sunset Bay, the next leg stretched up to Dunes Recreation Area near Dune City, where we stashed the bikes for an overnight backpacking trip to a dispersed site on the dunes near Three Mile Lake.

During our time in Port Orford and Coos Bay, we stopped at two coastal co-ops to interview them about their history and the strong sense of community they’ve fostered.

Next we rode to Cummins Creek Wilderness Area for a 2 night backpacking trip around the trails.  This was another of our favorite areas, covered with beautiful old growth sitka spruce, some of which stretched to 9 feet in diameter.

After hiking out of Cummins Creek, we rode through Florence up the coast to Waldport, where we made extensive use of the Waldport library before staying the night at a nearby Hipcamp site.  The next morning we paid a visit to the Greenbikes Co-op a community bike repair shop, where we learned of another couple on a tandem who had toured for 10 years and had two children while touring!

From Waldport, we headed north for a few more miles of 101 before turning off toward Cape Lookout State Park.

We took two days to cross from Tillamook in to Portland.

Portland is a town rich with cooperative businesses.  During our stay in Portland, we took a day to tour a loop to visit all the co-ops we could pack into one day.

The loop started in Multnomah Village and proceeded over the beautiful Terwilliger Blvd ride into downtown Portland, passing by the statue Portlandia and many downtown Portland attractions.  Next we traveled to the northwest part of the city to get an early lunch at Food Front Co-op.

We crossed the Willamette river at the Broadway Bridge to visit the eastern neighborhoods.  We rode north to Alberta Co-op to grab some blueberries and granola, before heading roundabout way up Mt Tabor for some views of the city.

From Mt Tabor, we headed west toward the Buckman neighborhood.  We stopped into the Citybikes worker co-op to restock on new high-quality tires and tubes.

Finally, we stopped into People's Food Co-op, an amazing store where we grabbed a bottle of local cooperatively produced wine before heading back to our Warmshower's host in Multnomah Village.


Along the route, we also passed two other worker co-ops that were unfortunately closed during our ride.  Common Ground Wellness Co-op, a cooperatively run spa that would surely have been wonderful after our last three weeks of touring.  And Mirisata, a Sri Lankan restaurant and worker co-op that we wished we'd have had the chance to eat at, but which is only open a few days per week at the moment.  Cetainly these will be two locations we look forward to visiting in the future.

Heading east from Portland you can catch the old Columbia River highway, the first scenic highway built in the US, that along the Columbia River Gorge. This is a stunning area, a gaping gorge shaped by basalt flows and massive floods, with the higest concentration of waterfals in the country. Plus it has wonderful bike route. The old highway was finished in 1920 and later abandoned when a larger highway was built further down the gorge to handle the high traffic. But the old highway is being restored for tourists and some sections are biking/hiking only. We stopped at the Bonneville fish hatchery, which you can visit for free, and saw 6ft sturgeon in their ponds. The sturgeon are an ancient-looking fish that hasn't changed much over time and remind me of a shark.

We also tried to visit the Bonneville lock and dam, but cyclists and pedestrians are only allowed on the first island to see the locks, you need to be in a vehicle to cross the next bridge to the damn. By coincidence a barge was coming through just as we arrived and we watched the locks in action. Two large barges came through side by side, with only a couple feet of clearance on either side of the channel wall, and millions of gallons of water drained in 20 minutes! But this also made us reflect on what it means to tame the rivers this way, many creatures that depend on the river are affected, for example, the sturgeon populations upstream of the damn are doing much worse than those below the damn.

In, terms of camping along the way the X campground has hiker/biker sites, but there are also lots of trails for backpacking into the Mount Hood National Forest. We hiked in along Eagle Creek, one of the most popular trails for a good reason. You're up along cliffs, with so many waterfalls they don't all get named, and you can even pass through a tunnel behind one of the falls (aptly named Tunnel Falls). A bit of an adrenaline rush as you're also along a cliff which is now slippery as it gets wet. Camping is allowed anywhere past 3.3 miles, where you cross the high bridge. You'll know it when you see it.

We found the best spots with water access (you'll want a dip in the cool creek) a mile or 2 further along. After 2 nights we hiked out and continued east. The biking trail has a small set of stairs, but very manageable, and extends to Bridge of the Gods. The scenic bikeway is currently awaiting another section to be built (so bikes can eventually avoid 84 completely), if you want to continue east on the Oregon side.

We crossed at the Bridge of the Gods, its where the PCT hikers cross too, and has a 15 mph limit for cars so felt very safe. However, then you are on highway 14, which is akin to 101. Going very early in the morning helped to avoid the trucks.

There is also 2 miles of intermittent short tunnels, which have warning lights that bikers can activate to let cars know there is a bike inside. We did these at 6am and had no trouble. There are craft breweries and wineries throughout this area, well earned after a long days ride. There is also a bit of a reprieve from 14 along route 8. Some boulders have fallen into 8 at the beginning, but it clears up soon. This takes you up, with great views of the Columbia.

Our journey took us to Klickitat, so we took a turn up 142 and followed the swiftly flowing Klickitat river, with views of Mount Hood. Rafters were floating down in the calmer parts and we took a dip to escape the heat. It gets quite hot. There is also a gravel trail but not worth it unless you have a serious mountain bike (really large gravel), we tried and turned around (fyi, cell service drops off as you head up).

Blah blah

## High Cascades
Mt adams and rainier national park were two of the highlights of the pacific northwest (the other being the <a href="2021/08/04/log-olympic-discovery-trail.html">Olympic Peninsula</a>). We started from The Klickitat wilderness area, which has 2 campgrounds that are free for bikers and hikers and are first come first served. The road to get there from Klickitat is a pretty but steep ride with minimal traffic that follows the Klickitat River and rises high above the gorge. The Leidel Campground is particularly nice, with spots right along the river. It is large and finding a spot even on a Saturday in summer way easy. Note Klickitat only has a general store, so resupply earlier if
you want certain food.

To head toward Mt Adams, the only resupply point we found was in Glenwood, at a general store about 10 miles south of Gifford Pinchot forest. They also serve hot breakfast, coffee and burgers and have free wifi and a portapotty. The ride there has great views of Mt Adams. After another 43 miles and X ft of elevation the road crosses the PCT and there is a creek 300 ft in on the right side, if you need water or to cool off.

There are many trailheads in the Mt adams area. We did the Divide Trail, which we highly recommend, but Goat Rocks is supposed to be even better. The Divide Trail has ample places to stash a bike at the trail head and the hike in is modest elevation, only 5 miles and will reward you with views of Adams, Rainier and St Helens. To get there, the roads are gravel the whole way with roughly 1000 feet of elevation, but very little traffic. There are a few places to camp along the trail. Note that High Camp requires crossing a river that is is only foldable in the early morning when snowmelt levels are still low. There are also great spots before the turn to High Camp, explore the little trails off the main one to find them. There is a clear stream to get water beyond the powerful, silty river that lies to the right of the main trail up. Its about 0.3 miles. Also, be aware of mosquitoes, at least in July, they were brutal. We wore rainjackets and hid in the tent when not actively moving. However, this is supposedly better than the biting fly season later on and July still has lots of wildflowers.

To get to Rainier, Randall and Packwood are 2 food resupply points, with decent grocery stores and a few restaurants. Packwood also has a library, coffee shop and brewery. Getting from the Divide Trailhead to Randall is a nice downhill ride. Its gravel at first but then paved for 27/35 miles. It is in the national forest for most of the way and follows the Cispus River, with  camping spots along it. If your goal is to get to Packwood, going via Randall seems like the easier way to get there and is what we did. Taking 12 to Packwood is flat with wide shoulder. To approach Rainier from Packwood, Forest Road 52 follows Skate Creek through more National Forest to the park and has lots of camping pullouts along it. This will get you close to the Nisqually entrance in case you want to get up early to try for a walk in wilderness permit, office opens at 7:30.

# Western Washington

## Rainier to Seattle
"This route is a ride from the southwest corner of Mount Rainier National Park into downtown Seattle. We've run the route northbound toward Seattle which makes it much easier to complete in 1 day thanks to the 2000 foot decline from Mount Rainier.  The route from Rainier to the edge of Orting, WA is a bit of a pain mostly on road with little shoulder, but once you hit the Foothills trail you can be riding on separated bicycle trails almost the whole way to downtown Seattle.

The first segments on Foothills Trail from Orting to Pyallup and Sumner Link trail through Sumner are particularly lovely. On the Sumner Link Trail you will also pass through a suburban industrial area and if you keep your eyes peeled you can see REIs headquarters campus.

The Interurban trail is less scenic but we are still very grateful it is there as a 15 mile long connector through the south Seattle suburbs.

When 20 miles from downtown, you'll find another beautiful Green River trail.  From here your route may vary along the streets of Seattle's neighborhoods depending on your final destination."
"We built this route specifically to hit the major urban centers of the South Puget Sound. We don't recommend this ride for enjoyment, but if needing to get from Seattle to Olympia we found this route worked well.

## Seattle to Olympia
We started near Capitol Hill in Seattle and visited the PCC Co-op to fuel up for our first day.  We snaked along the West Seattle cycling bridge to west Seattle towards the Vashon Island ferry. Crossing the sound by ferry cuts off a decent chunk of the ride and getting to see Vashon Island was an interesting introduction to the islands of the Seattle area. We rode the west side of the island stopping only for a quick hike along the Shinglemill Creek Trail (and multiple stops for the abundant blackberries in summertime).

At the south tip of Vashon you can cross the ferry into Tacoma.  We didn't find much of a route in Tacoma, but did stop at the newly established Central Co-op to grab our supplies for the next day.

The road from Tacoma to Olympia can be treacherous if you don't know about the secret cycling route. Normal map routing software will probably tell you that you have to do a short segment of interstate 5, but there is another secret route that is open to cyclists.  You can follow our graphhopper route to a gap in a fence at the end of a fancy suburban road. On the other side you'll find a road through a good course and back around toward Olympia.

Once you arrive in Olympia, be sure to eat at the fantastic New Moon Cafe. This worker-owned restaurant's vegetable dishes are delicious and their tempeh is some of the best we've ever had.

If you need gear before the next segment of your trip, you can check out Olympia Gear Exchange, a business dedicated to sustainable reuse of outdoor gear. Sadly during our time in Olympia we had our rear panniers stolen off of our bicycle (the first items stolen during 2 months of touring) which caused us to very much need the gear exchange as we replaced our tent. We wish better luck for you if you visit Olympia."


## Olympia to Port Townsend
"After leaving Olympia, the first segment mostly follows 101, which has a considerably wide shoulder, despite the loud and heavy traffic.  We split off at highway 3 and passed through Shelton to take Brookdale and Webb Hill roads to Skokomish. From Skokomish we again picked up a largely shoulder-less 101 to ride to Potlatch State Park. Recognizing that this segment of 101 was incredibly unfriendly to bikes, we broke camp at dawn to put in the next 40 or so miles of 101 on in the early hours of morning.

But everything changed for the better when we hit Center Road in Quilcene. This was our first encounter with the wonderfully bike friendly Jefferson County.  From there our trip along Center Rd and Highways 19 and 20 to Fort Townsend state park was a pleasure along the highly hospitable and well-maintained shoulder.

We stayed two nights in the Port Townsend area, with accomodations at the hiker/biker sites in both Fort Townsend and Fort Wordford state parks. While the beachfront views of quaint Port Townsend are wonderful at Port Wordford, the strong ocean breeze blew our neighbors staked tent away and makes the night sleep in the sitka spruce Grove of Fort Townsend SP preferable.


## The Olympic Discovery Trail to Olympic National Park
Leaving Port Townsend we picked up our first stretch of the fantastic Olympic Discovery Trail&mdash;a trail we've come to cherish during our tour of the Olympic Peninsula.  The ride along highways 20 and 101 along the Miller peninsula past Gardiner to Blunt were altogether not terrible with a few side tracks that allowed some respite from the highway. But at Blyn you can pick up another longer chunk of the Olympic Discovery trail that will bring you through Sequim (pronounced Squim), where you can stay at the hiker/biker in Dungeness Recreation Area.

From here, much of the remainder of the trip to Olympic National Park can follow the Olympic Discovery trail, aside from a brief but frustrating segment on a nearly shoulder-less highway 112.

Nevertheless the ride on the Discovery trail is worth it in itself, including a fascinating bridge crossing at X and the magical tunnel route along the north side of the crystal blue water of Lake Crescent. This entire route takes a long slow climb to Sol Duc River Rd, where you can enter Olympic National Park.

For our trip, we headed up to Sol Duc trailhead to start a 7 day backpacking trip around Seven Lakes Basin and up to Glacier Meadow at the base of Mount Olympus.

## Anacortes to Bellingham

# The crazy bike rebuild in Coos Bay


# Back to Mendocino without electric power

# The great reset

Selling everything, staying with friends in SF, rebuilding our ebikes



# The Big Sur Coastline

An important difference for planning once south of SF is that the hiker/biker (h/b) sites are limited to 1 or 2 days, some have closed and the rate doubles to $10 a night. North Beach and Lompoc no longer have a h/b. I heard if you call ahead, Lompoc may let you stay. Gaviota was closed for the season starting 10-1.  Half moon bay and New Brighton are 1 day along with a few more. Also there are also gaps in the state parks that are filled by county or forest service camps (Kirk creek along Big Sur (a must see for the costal views and stars, but the water is sold for $5 a gallon or you can filter from the creek) and Costal Dunes RV park and campground in Oceana).  It may be worth getting a map that lists them all. Also, if you go later in the year, some of the parks partially or fully close after 10-31. Manrita closes and Sunset Beach moves the h/b site.

On Oct 27 we departed San Francisco along hwy 1 at Golden Gate Park. There is a decent shoulder most of the way, just a couple of short sections without shoulder immediately south of the park. We found cars to be decent, they slow down or give you space, and traffic not bad, I'm mot sure if this was because it was November or because here hwy 1 is mostly a scenic route. We camped at Half Moon bay the first night.

Then we made it 60 miles to New Brighton, which is outside of Santa Cruz. The next day we doubled back into Santa Cruz for bike repairs. The Bike Church in Santa Cruz is a worker co-op community bike shop that is awesome.

That night we were headed down to Sunset Beach and luckily along the way met another cyclist, Geoff, who told us about Manrita, a more chill campground  that lets you stay for 2 days (but it closes on 11-1). We relaxed there for 2 days, the beach was beautiful and we even saw some porpoises.

On 11-1 we just went 2 miles to Sunset Beach to wait out the rain and then the motor controller on one of the bikes broke and needed to be soldered. So we got at a warm showers in Watsonville for the next day to do the repairs. It is a quaint town and a local reporter saw us sitting out with our solar panels and did a little story on us!

** Turns our it was the house of a famous bike designer Craig camfee, (the account was under his wife's name). He made the first carbon fiber bike frame, which is now state of the art, and invented the bamboo bike.

The next morning we left early in the fog to make it 61 miles to Pfeiffer Big Sur state park campground. The ride along big sur is stunning, majestic sweeping views of the ocean and mountains, possibly the most beautiful section of coast. There are many sections with no shoulder, but the cars are so considerate that it never felt unsafe. We spent 1 day at the campground and then hoped to  park our bikes and hike into the Sykes River hot springs (10 mile hike) for a couple days. We asked around to see if there was somewhere safe to lock the bikes and a couple panniers (a camp host in Oregon had let us leave our stuff with him). We talked to 3 people and it was no's all around, but Will finally convinced them to let us pay for another day of h/b site to lock our bikes up there (note that this counts as a day of camping and there is a 2 day limit). This costs the same as parking a car at the trailhead, even though our bikes take up a fraction of the space. It would be amazing if just 1 parking spot could be turned into a bike rack with a couple bear box style lockers to lock a few valuables while hiking. We resolved to advocate for this in the future.

But for now we set off to hike the pine ridge trail for 10 miles with 2500ft of elevation gain to reach the Sykes hot springs. The hike goes inland from the coast along a ridge in the Ventana wilderness. It passes 3 trail camps before Sykes so you don't have to do it all in 1 day. We were very luck to be here, the area had been closed for 5 years due to fire damage and part of the trail getting washed out. Once you reach the Sykes camp, there are campsites up and down river and the springs are .5 miles down river on the left side, with a few river crossings. There are half a dozen small round pools tucked into the rocky outcroppings above the river that are nice and warm!

We camped there and then headed back out the next day, with one more day of camp at the state park to rest our legs. At camp we met a fellow cyclist, Stuart, who had a book with all the h/b campgrounds!

The next day we headed to one from Stuart's book, Kirk Creek campground, and we are happy we did! It was about 30 miles, with resupply at Big Sur Deli.  Kirk creek is right on the ocean with views of the mountains and amazing stars at night, it is stunning,  but bring water or a filter or they sell it for 5 a gallon. This ride along highway 1 is also stunning. Steep mountain sides dropping into the ocean with tall bridges and even a short tunnel built of rock right in to the side of the mountain (it looked like it was out of The Lord of the Rings). The ocean was such a deep blue, the sky so clear and the mountains so green, it looked like paradise. When you stop at the pullout to look back you can't imagine what you just came over, such a tiny road carved into the mountain side.

The next day we planned to bike a bit and then do a 2 mile hike into a campground from Salmon Creek Falls trailhead. The only resupply point is the Gorda general store. The parking lot for Salmon Creek is small and exposed so a good place to leave bikes is by the Buckeye Trailhead, just 100 yards up the road. We also took a quick jaunt up part of this trail for the views- you get high up along the mountainside and can see the whole coast and ocean stretch out before you. We saw one of the most amazing sunsets from the Salmon Creek Falls trail.

The next day we had the last leg of the Big Sur coast to ride, the dreaded Ragged Point. It was super windy with lots of switchbacks, which were a bit terrifying with the wind. Luckily there was almost no traffic and I rode in the left lane a bit to be as far away from the edge as possible. Once we got past Ragged Point it was all downhill and opened into nice flat land. There is an elephant seal view point here and it is definitely worth the stop, the beach was jam packed with sunbathing seals. It looked so relaxing. We stayed at Morrow Bay.

Overall, the Big Sur section is the most scenic part of the whole coast and felt the safest for cycling. There was very little traffic and all the cars all shared the road, it felt like they actually cared about you and wanted to make sure you don't die. Very heart warming. I don't know how much this relates to it being the off season or not, could be due to them being terrified about driving these narrow, winding roads, but it would be a much more nerve wracking ride with lots of traffic

Unfortunately after this the camping is not ideal (North Beach and Lompoc closed their h/b).  There is a country campground with h/b, Costal Dunes RV park and campground in Oceana. It is right on the highway and by train tracks and is $13 per person, but it has electric and free showers and laundry on site.

**I got the first flat of the trip in the rain on the way there. A giant screw. The patch didn't hold and turns out the screw went in one side of the tube and out the other. So I changed the tube. Then 3 miles from our destination, a 3 inch nail gouged my tire. It would not hold air after that. Luckily this was a 10 min walk from the Costal Dunes RV park and campground so we changed plans and went there. Thank goodness there was an Ace in town and it opened at 7am. We got their last tube and tire in my size. We needed to leave as early as possible because we had to make it 73 miles before sundown (now around 5pm) (the Lompoc h/b has been shut down and Graviota had closed on 10/1 for the season). We also needed 3 days of food. Will did the errands while I packed and luckily we made it out by 9:30.

The ride from here to Refugio State Beach is long but nice, huge shoulders and off of hwy 1 for a bit. It goes inland for a bit to skirt the airforce base and passes through lots of ag land, fields and fields of cabbages kale and broccoli filling the whole valley. And hoop houses covering acres and acres. Its important to see for ourselves where our food actually comes from.

**Also it is so crazy to see the organic weed control done at scale, black tarps cover field after field. Its shiny in the sun and looks surreal. I hope the can re-use it year to year. No solution is ever as good as it seems. All the farm workers were out in the fields, it looked very hot.

Happened upon a strawberry stand (??) Along hwy 1 outside of Callender that was the best I've ever had. They pick them daily when they are ripe, not early like needs to be done when they are shipped to stores. This perked us right up for the next 20 miles. This section was now rolling green hills of pasture with sparse trees and bushes and a few black cows grazing here and there, all with a backdrop of some taller peaks. It was quite empty, no towns or gas stations or houses at all, and was quite hot and dry. Then you need to hop onto 101 for a bit and out of nowhere it goes through a mini canyon with sheer  rock walls for a couple miles, then all of a sudden pops you back out on the coast. And its a totally different coast, we were now in southern California. Big flat beaches and palm trees and warm breezes. What a difference to not have the winds be cold and dense with fog.

# The Southern California vibes

We camped at Refugio state Beach, which is lovely. The h/b site here has the best view in the house, right on the sandy beach with views of the islands.

**Good lesson leaned today to confirm the campsites from here on out. Gaviotas was randomly closed with no mention on the website or phone and Lompoc, which was on the map, has also been closed. We have read that the h/b sites have been shut down due to the homeless population. What a way to not solve the real underlying problem.


We stayed in Refugio 2 days two days for a rest day. Then just did 2 miles to El Capitan state park, since we had heard so much about it. You can take hwy 1, but a local told us that there is a bike path from Refugio that ends on the beach and if we ride the beach for a mile there is a ramp up to El Capitan state park. We figured why not! It was so fun to ride along the sand, right next to the waves and chasing sea gulls.  El capitan is also right on the ocean but raised on a bluff, with amazing views and sunset. Plus the h/b is off on its own with a staircase down to a basically empty beach (the crowds were further down).

From here is it 20 miles to Santa Barbara. You have to be on 1 for a bit but then you can take side streets through the towns and there is a bike path from UCSB onward. Santa Barbara had lots of bike paths and fun beaches with public restrooms.

Here we interviewed the Regenerative Landscaping Co-op, Regen.coop. It was very inspiring. I hope these ideas of water management spread far and fast. Then we did a quick 12 miles to Carpentria state park, all of which is off of hwy 1. We heard there is a brewery that overlooks it so you can drink and watch your stuff but we were too wiped.

The next day, we did 50 miles to Leo Carillo state Beach. Some of this is along 1 and some on frontage roads, but not bad. The best part was when a separated 2-way bike path appeared along the highway. Sycamore canyon is another option along this stretch. Leo Carillo h/b is in a secluded wooded/sunny area. We managed to eek out 3 days because you can self register in the morning before the ranger station opens and the h/b is so hidden that no one can see if you're back there. Is also has a camp store with basic foods (think gas station). Some cool sea caves and tide pools are along the beach there.

The next day we passed through Malibu on the way to LA and this is the first time we were honked at since entering CA back in October. The shoulder is used as parking so you basically have to take the lane on 1 and the cars do not like to share. Then navigating LA is a nightmare. The lack of bike lanes in such a major city is astonishing. But union station is nice and its easy to take a bike on Amtrak. You can sometimes roll it on yourself, or trainside roll it to an operator, but there were no reservations for bikes left so we boxed ours. You buy the box at the ticket counter, they bring it down. You don't even take the wheels off, just the pedals and twist the handlebars. They even tape the box up for you. Then we set off to on our first train ride of the trip.
