We set out north along the coast on Highway 1. Once we got north of Fort Bragg the traffic lessens and the coast becomes rolling hills with amazing views of the ocean. And wild blackberries if you're there in late summer. The road turns inland and starts a steep climb after Westport to get over the south end of the King Range and connect with 101. This climb was rough. This section of 101 wasn't bad, there was a decent shoulder, and there are views of the Eel River all along. On the third day we got to the Avenue of the Giants, a scenic route off 101 that travels through the old growth redwoods. It's magical to bike through these ancient trees. Humbolt Redwoods State Park is along this road and has many trails and groves to explore.
