The North Coast of California is the first segment of the Co-op Trail to be explored.  The two most prominent features of the area are the breathtaking coastal cliffs and the magnificent Giant Redwood forests.


Our trip started in Point Arena with a trip to the fantastic Point Arena Hot Springs on the Garcia River.  The hot springs were at the end of an arduous but beautiful 12 mile hike up the Garcia river with more than 60 river crossings in an often waist deep Garcia River.


The <a href="https://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM29GE">directions</a> for the 12 mile hike were sparse. We often thought the river would be impassable with our packs, but somehow we always managed to find a way around. At the end of a beautiful overnight hike, we made our way back down to Point Arena and resupplied for our trip at the <a href="/2021/04/20/arena-market.html">Arena Market and Cafe</a>.


We next continued on our trip northward to the Mendocino-Fort Bragg area.  We are staying in the area for another few months to visit several co-ops in the area, while we are waiting to be vaccinated.
