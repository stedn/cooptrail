Coos Head is a friendly, welcoming co-op, deeply involved in bettering their community and educating the world about the benefits of healthy and sustainable food.

We were fortunate enough to talk with Jamar, Coos Head's outreach coordinator, about the wonderful things the co-op has been doing in their community, how they live the co-op principles, and all the delicious, local, organic food they offer.
