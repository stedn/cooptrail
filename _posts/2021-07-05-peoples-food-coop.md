People's Food Co-op is probably our personal favorite food co-op in Portland, and maybe even thus far in the whole US.  Even before entering, we found the parklet outside with this informative sign about what was going on.

The store is also super nice and well-stocked with great produce and interesting local foods.

We learned about the very interesting <a href="https://www.pdx.coop">pdx.coop</a> and got a nice bottle of wine for our hosts in town.
