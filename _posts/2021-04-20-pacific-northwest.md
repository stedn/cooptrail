The North Coast of California is the first segment of the Co-op Trail to be explored.  The two most prominent features of the area are the breathtaking coastal cliffs and the magnificent giant coastal forests.  This segment of the trail starts to the south in Pomo territory and continues north through the lands of the Yuki, Cahto, Sinkyone, and Mattole peoples and finally up into Wiyot country in the north.  We are grateful to these First Peoples for stewarding this land for thousands of years before we got here.


Our trip started in Point Arena where we resupplied for our trip at the <a href="/2021/04/20/arena-market.html">Arena Market and Cafe</a> consumer co-op.


We next continued on our trip northward to the Mendocino-Fort Bragg area.  In this area, the <a href="http://www.grassroots-institute.org/">Grassroots Institute</a> has already done great work building a local map of the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1X_uBTr3c4jD_KQhAQmdWmlVDIT5FlqkU&ll=39.400166199864366%2C-123.52544655000001&z=9">Economy for the Common Good</a>, which we relied on to research organizations in this area.

We visited the <a href="/2021/04/21/corners-of-the-mouth.html">Corners of the Mouth market</a>, a worker-owned co-op founded in 1975.
