A worker owned collective since 1975

Every dollar earned goes directly to the workers, to the store or back into the community.

The highest quality food, supplements and housewares from sources we trust.

Corners of the Mouth had opened in 1975 just down the street in the Kelliowen building.  In 1976 the businesses switched places and Corners has filled the church ever since.
