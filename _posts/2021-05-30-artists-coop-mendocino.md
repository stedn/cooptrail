The Artists' Co-op of Mendocino was established in June 1988 for the purpose of selling members' art. Mendocino has been an artist hub for many years after being saved from virtual extinction by a local art school.  The Artists' Co-op is owned and operated by its members, who all live in the area and manage the gallery together.

We interviewed artist and co-op member Debra Lennox about the history of the co-op as well as the art on display in their Gallery.
