The Artists' Co-op of Mendocino was established in June 1988 for the purpose of selling members' art. The Co-op is owned and operated by the members, which number fifteen to twenty. Selected guest artists are featured periodically.

We interviewed artist and co-op member Debra Lennox about the history of the co-op as well as the art on display in the Gallery.
