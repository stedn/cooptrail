Next we rode to Cummins Creek Wilderness Area for a 2 night backpacking trip around the trails.  This was another of our favorite areas, covered with beautiful old growth sitka spruce, some of which stretched to 9 feet in diameter.

After hiking out of Cummins Creek, we rode through Florence up the coast to Waldport, where we made extensive use of the Waldport library before staying the night at a nearby Hipcamp site.  The next morning we paid a visit to the Greenbikes Co-op a community bike repair shop, where we learned of another couple on a tandem who had toured for 10 years and had two children while touring!

From Waldport, we headed north for a few more miles of 101 before turning off toward Cape Lookout State Park.

We took two days to cross from Tillamook in to Portland.
