Corners of the Mouth is a worker-owned food co-op in picturesque Mendocino California.  The co-op is housed in a former church, giving it a very interesting atmosphere.

We visited and talked with some of the workers about what makes Corners an institution in the Mendocino community and why it's such a great place to work and shop.
