One of the hugely important parts of strengthening the solidarity economy is building resources for learning about and helping start new cooperatives.  As part of out visit to LA we spoke with Citlalli Velasquez of the <a href="https://lacooplab.com/">LA Co-op Lab</a> about the work they are doing to jumpstart the cooperative economy in Los Angeles.

> The LA Co-op Lab is a collective that was established in 2015 to explore & invent ways to build L.A.'s capacity for worker ownership as a pathway toward a more equitable and democratic economy.  Their aim is to advance worker ownership as one way to push back against inequality, gentrification, and the gig economy by helping people who are often excluded from good jobs to collectively create their own and meet community needs.


One of the main offerings of the LA co-op lab is education and teaching/coaching. They have online workshops about co-ops. An introductory workshop about what a co-op is (free to anyone) and a more in-depth workshop for those who are actively in the process of forming their own co-op. They also have open office hours for coaching on the process of becoming a co-op, on everything from the dreaming phase of wanting to start one to digging into business plans.

The LA Co-op Lab is currently helping a number of worker owned resteraunts get off the ground.  During Covid, restaurant staff finally had enough of the way they were being treat and many have decided to start worker-owned restaurant co-ops.  It's an exciting time for the expansion of the cooperative ethics and worker empowerment

They were also one of the founding members of <a href="https://seedcommons.org/about-seed-commons/">Seed Commons</a>, a national network of locally rooted, non-extractive loan funds that brings the power of big finance under community control. As a part of that organization the LA Co-op Lab focuses on those who have less access to traditional forms of capital/loans. For potential candidates, they don't consider your personal collateral but rather 1) your connections in the community where your business will be and and if it is providing a missing resource for that community, ie a grocery store in a food desert, and 2) your skills/expertise in the relevant area for the business you want to start, ie line cooks and wait staff who want to start a restaurant. If a loan does go into default, personal property won't be at risk, only items purchased with the loan itself.

The LA co-op lab also feels it is important for any potential co-ops they work with to abide by the 7 cooperative principles. One of the especially important ones if Concern for Community. So if a business operaties democratically (one of the principles) but does't care for the surrounding community, then they don't fully embody the cooperative prinicples. For example, an oil refinery could be run democratically but it is harming the surrounding community, so it would not be eligible to work with the LA co-op lab.

We learned a lot talking with Citlalli, and we hope you learn something too. And the next time you're in Los Angeles, look into the network of co-ops that the LA Co-op Lab is helping to develop.
