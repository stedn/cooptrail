During Covid, restaurant staff finally had enough of the way they were being treat and many have decided to start worker-owned restaurant co-ops, there are 3 working with the LA co-op lab currently.

One of the main offerings of the LA co-op lab is education and teaching/coaching. They have online workshops about co-ops. An introductory workshop about what a co-op is (free to anyone) and a more in-depth workshop for those who are actively in the process of forming their own co-op. They also have open office hours for coaching on the process of becoming a co-op, on everything from the dreaming phase of wanting to start one to digging into business plans.

They were one of the founding members of Seed Sovereignty (is this right?), a non-extractive lending model (need to check language on that), which focuses on those who have less access to traditional forms of capital/loans. For potential candidates, they don't consider your personal collateral but rather 1) your connections in the community your business will be and and if it is providing a missing resource for that community, ie a grocery store in a food desert, and 2) your skills/expertise in the relevant area for the business you want to start, ie line cooks and wait staff who want to start a restaurant. If a loan does go into default, personal property won't be at risk, only items purchased with the loan itself.

The LA co-op lab also feels it is important for any potential co-ops they work with to abide by the 7 cooperative principles. One of the especially important ones if Concern for Community. So if a business operaties democratically (one of the principles) but does't care for the surrounding community, then they don't fully embody the cooperative prinicples. For example, an oil refinery could be run democratically but it is harming the surrounding community, so it would not be eligible to work with the LA co-op lab.
