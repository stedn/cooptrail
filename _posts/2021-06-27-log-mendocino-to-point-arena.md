6/12/21: Leave Fort Bragg, head north along Hwy 1 and up the steep climb toward Leggitt. We'd made the trip up the coast before but never made the turn inland across the King Range. It was only 1/4 mile before we realized how much extra weight we'd brought. We dumped 2 gallons of water as we limped along. The rear axel twisted out of place a few times, but luckily no flat tires (yet).
