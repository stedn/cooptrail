Making the detour to Petrolia is well worth it. This was one of our favorite sections. There is a mighty steep climb from Ferndale up over the North end of the King Range but you are rewarded with gorgeous green mountain meadows. The road traverses for awhile and then drops down into a valley, which means another steep climb out, before it reaches the coast, where you get stunning views of the Pacific and the rocky outcroppings that dot the shoreline. Then you bike down 'the wall' as you quickly descend to sea level. The path follows the coast and is thankfully flat for a few miles. There are usually surfers at x Beach. The turn up the x Valley leads you into the Mattole watershed and the houses of the tiny town of Petrolia peek up from among the hills as you wind your way inland.
