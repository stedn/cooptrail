A big co-op presence in a small 1300 person town, Port Orford Food Co-op was a great place to take a pit stop and recharge with some local organic food from the bulk bins.

While we were there, we interviewed co-op volunteer worker Laurie about the fantastic community support that makes the Port Orford Co-op possible. And they have solar panels! A quick ticket into our hearts here on the Co-op Trail.
