Heading east from Portland you can catch the old Columbia River highway, a scenic route along the Columbia River Gorge. This is a stunning area, a gaping gorge shaped by basalt flows and floods, and wonderful biking experience. The old highway was finished in 19xx and later abandoned when a larger highway was built further down the gorge to handle the high traffic. The old highway is being restored to allow visitors to the numerous waterfalls that  drop down the gorge (the highest concentration of waterfalls in the country) and some sections are biking/hiking only. We stopped at the xx hatchery, which you can visit for free, and saw 6ft long sturgeon in their ponds. An ancient fish that hasn't changed much over time and looks prehistoric.


We also tried to visit the Boneville lock and dam, but cyclists and pedestrians are only allowed on the first island to see the locks, you need to be in a vehicle to cross the next bridge to the damn. By coincidence a barge was coming through just as we arrived and we watched the locks in action. But also reflected on what it means to tame the rivers this way, and all the creatures that are affected, the sturgeon populations upstream of the damn isn't doing great.

The xx campground is part way along and has hiker/biker sites, but there are also lots of trails for backpacking into the Mount Hood National Forest. We hiked in along Eagle Creek, one of the most popular trails for good reason. You're up along cliffs, with so many waterfalls they don't all get named, and can even pass through a tunnel behind one of the falls (aptly named Tunnel Falls).


You can camp anywhere past 3.3 miles, where you cross the high bridge.

We found the best spots with water access (you'll want a dip in the cool creek) a mile or 2 further along. After 2 nights we hiked out and continued east. The biking trail has a small set of stairs, but very managable, and extends to Bridge of the Gods. The scenic bikeway is currently awaiting another section to be built so you can avoid 84 completely, if you want to continue east on the Oregon side.


We crossed at the Bridge of the Gods, its where the PCT hikers cross too and has a 15mph limit for cars so felt very safe. However, then you are on highway 14, which is akin to 101. Going very early in the morning helped to avoid the trucks.

There is also 2 miles of intermittent short tunnels, which have warning lights thay bikers can activate to let cars know there is a bike inside. We did these at 6am and had no trouble. There are craft breweries and wineries throughout this area, well earned after a long days ride. There is reprieve from 14 along only route 8. Some boulders have fallen into the road at the beginning but it clears up soon. This takes you up, with great views of the Columbia. Getting to Klickitat takes a turn up 142 and follows the swifly flowing Klickitat river, with views of Mount Hood. Rafters were floating down in the calmer parts and we took a dip to escape the heat. It gets quite hot. There is also a gravel trail but not worth it unless you have a serious mountain bike, we tried and turned around (fyi, cell service drops off as you head up).
