One of the most succesful food co-ops in the western United States, North Coast Food Co-op started in the 1970s and expanded consistently through the 80s and 90s.  The co-op now occupies two locations around the Eureka-Arcata region, each of which rivals any commercial grocery in selection, size, and amenities.

Definitely a good stop when traveling through the Northern California area.
