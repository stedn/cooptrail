We just finished building our own solar charging electric tandem bicycle, and Claire was excited to show off all the features we built in for life on the road.  We've wanted to do #vanlife for a long time, but electric vans don't have the range needed for cross-country yet.  This setup was our way to do a lower impact cycling+backpacking tour, but still carry and power all the equipment we need.
